# ShadowVM: Advanced Windows Security Isolation System

## Overview

ShadowVM is a sophisticated security isolation and monitoring system designed for Windows environments, providing advanced protection mechanisms for executing potentially untrusted code or applications. The project implements multiple layers of security to create a robust, comprehensive containment and monitoring solution.

## Key Components

### 1. Security System Architecture

The system is built around three primary components:

- **Resource Monitor**: Tracks and logs system resource access
- **Jail Layer**: Provides process and resource containment
- **ShadowVM**: Implements low-level code and syscall monitoring

### 2. Resource Monitoring

The Resource Monitor offers extensive tracking of system resources, including:
- File System Access
- Network Operations
- Memory Usage
- Registry Interactions
- Process Creation
- DLL Loading

#### Key Features:
- Configurable resource tracking
- Suspicious activity detection
- Detailed logging
- Performance metrics collection

### 3. Jail Layer

The Jail Layer creates an isolated environment for process execution with:
- Filesystem sandboxing
- Network access control
- Resource limit enforcement
- Process isolation using Windows Job Objects

### 4. ShadowVM Virtualization

ShadowVM provides a sophisticated code execution environment with:
- Memory sandbox allocation
- Code pattern matching
- Syscall interception
- Execution monitoring
- Suspicious code detection

## Technical Implementation

### Hooking Mechanism

The system uses a custom hook implementation that:
- Intercepts system API calls
- Logs resource access
- Enables fine-grained monitoring
- Supports dynamic hook installation/removal

### Security Layers

Combines multiple security techniques:
1. **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks and logs all system interactions
2. **Process Isolation**: Restricts process capabilities
3. **Code Execution Monitoring**: Detects and prevents suspicious code patterns

## Use Cases

- Malware analysis
- Untrusted code execution
- Sandboxed application testing
- Security research
- Controlled environment deployment

## Security Principles

- Least Privilege
- Complete Monitoring
- Proactive Threat Detection
- Granular Access Control

## Build Requirements

- Windows SDK
- C99 Compiler (MSVC recommended)
- CMake 3.30+

## Compilation

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage Example

```c
// Initialize security system
SecuritySystem* system = security_init("security.log");

// Add security layers
add_jail_layer(system, "test_jail", "C:\\sandbox\\");
add_shadowvm_layer(system, 1024 * 1024);  // 1MB sandbox

// Execute command in secure environment
security_execute(system, "potentially_risky_program.exe");

// Cleanup
security_cleanup(system);
```

## Limitations

- Windows-specific implementation
- Performance overhead due to extensive monitoring
- Requires administrative privileges for full functionality

## Disclaimer

This is a research-grade security isolation system. While robust, it should not be considered a complete security solution without additional hardening.

## Future Improvements

- Cross-platform support
- More sophisticated pattern matching
- Enhanced machine learning-based threat detection
- Expanded resource tracking
